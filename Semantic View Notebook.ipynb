    "A Snowflake Semantic View is a  type of schema-level object in Snowflake that defines a business-friendly data model directly on your tables and views. Then, it can be used by AI and Humans to query data based on business needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is included in the Semantic View Definition?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logical Tables: These typically correspond to business entities (like CUSTOMER or ORDERS) and reference your underlying physical tables or views.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Relationships: These explicitly define how the logical tables connect to each other (e.g., how the CUSTOMER table links to the ORDERS table via a foreign key).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dimensions: These are the business-friendly attributes used to group, filter, or provide context to your data (e.g., Customer_Region, Product_Category, Order_Date).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Metrics: These are business-friendly calculations or aggregations that represent Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (e.g., Total_Sales, Average_Order_Value, Employee_Count). They use underlying data fields, sometimes called Facts, to perform the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use the Semantic View \n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to the **AI & ML** and search Cortex Analytics.\n",
    "* Use special Syntax Query.\n",
